I'd like to share my story of how I was preparing myself to German B1
certification exam. This article doesn't claim to be a "how to" article. I'd 
rather like to summarise some experience I've got from preparing to the
exam + share some ideas I have. I'd like to show my "lazy" method of 
preparation, which hardly help you to learn the language, but may help you
to pass the exam :) 

First of all, I want to say, that I'm not an expert in languages. I do not speak
neither German nor English at the descent level. The only thing is that I managed
to pass the exam and my experience might be useful for somebody.

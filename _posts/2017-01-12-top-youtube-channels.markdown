Happy New Year everybody! The new year has just begun and before we jump into
new challenges and our daily routines I’m going to share this non-serious and
rather relaxing post. I decided to make top list of my favourite youtube
channels. This list doesn't contain any professional or specific topics, only
the entertaining ones. This list neither pretend to be the list of the best
channels. It is rather channels which I often watch when I want to relax my
brain a little. Some of those channels are in Russian, so those channels
probably will not be interesting for English/German speaking audience. The list
is ordered alphabetically in a way as Youtube does it for me(so, the English
titles first). Here we go:

1. [BadComedian](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6cqazSR6CnVMClY0bJI0Lg):
    Movies reviews. A lot of fun, sarcasm and critics :) The videos are in Russian.

2. [DontTrustTheRabbit](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1-MpIG20o6kzsu1I5SLXpQ):
    Native German girl shares her thoughts about German/English languages,
    cultures etc.

3. [Jade Joddle's Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0MJBC99PMd86hDbaRTFmWg):
    English language, psychology, society, culture and other topics.

4. [Jared Dines](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJcYRr8rpsxVPfWA5vkuxFw):
    Funny music-related videos and sketches.

5. [Pima Live](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEb4vwhFFJcO8w-TrR8iRNw): Awesome guitar
    learning channel. Probably the best one I've ever seen. The content is in Russian.

6. [QI Quite Interesting](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtk3OPc31bHfVvvzC5ru04w):
    The British television quiz show series with Russian subtitles.

7. [Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason & Science](https://www.youtube.com/user/richarddawkinsdotnet/videos):
    Science, curious facts, secular topics etc.

8. [SandyMakesSense](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHGStxgm6fOP_p9TdIYJiLg):
    One more channel created by native German girl for English-speaking audience.

9. [SpectreSoundStudios](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-f76NUQN5M-Z0cd0MOP5xw):
    Sometimes humorous, sometimes practical videos about music production, gear
    reviews etc. A lot of "Your Bass Player is a Useless Cunt" videos. :)

10. [Woodeso's Guitar Mods](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNk-8pDv1tGMRml9b472qsQ): Amazing
    channel, created by canadian guy who is repairing a guitars and stuff. Really impressive videos.

11. [Агния Огонек](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD8cMdbEEcdIJsVtvwm836w): Internet-mems
    reviews. Apparently, it is in Russian.

12. [Александр Бубнов](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj49b9QYnEu_oqy-1HyXG8A):
    Football analytics and news. Unofficial channel of former soviet football
    player Alexander Bubnov. The videos are in Russian.

13. [Иван Сыромятников](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHImITX13FKpk7tPk8kO7-w):
    Guitar lessons, tips and tricks, gear setup and other guitar related videos.
    The channel is in Russian.

14. [Картавый Футбол](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYKXkKRqQqCoIAHG0_N32QQ):
    Football channel: some pseudo-analytics, some jokes… The channel is in Russian.

15. [ТОПЛЕС](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2Ru64PHqW4FxoP0xhQRvJg): Curious
    scientific facts and videos. In Russian.

16. [Я - васюхинец](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgG-B2hs6kjh4Fv_uNYukZQ):
    Another pseudo-expert in football. :) The channel is in Russian.


Some channels which I also watch a lot were not included in this list because
they are not really entertaining ones. On the other hand, I just can not let
them to be not mentioned there at all. :) For example, [kamikadzedead](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDbsY8C1eQJ5t6KBv9ds-ag)
was not included as I promised not to talk about politics in this blog since the very first post.
[Дмитрий ПОТАПЕНКО](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC54SBo5_usXGEoybX1ZVETQ) and
[Бизнес-секреты](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ErLqdnmXGMH-pccUQjwyA)
were not included as they are very business-oriented channels and for the vast
majority of my readers it's going to be just boring.

I hope you will find something interesting for you in this list :)

Bye for now!

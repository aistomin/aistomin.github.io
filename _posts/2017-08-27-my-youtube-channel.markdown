Hi guys! What's up? Some time ago along with this blog I decided to go further
in my socialisation and started my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_Xbh9rT4YiFL4U84oalEjQ).
I'm still not 100% sure what kind of content it
will be. For now I publish some of my self-made music here. Maybe in the
future there will also be some videos related to my other interests. In the post
below I will tell you couple of words about my channel. Keep on reading :)

For a long time I have been feeling like I wanted to create my channel and share some
stuff with the audience. Many times I stopped myself because this content is
not really professional and I was not sure how audience will accept it. I was
always like: no, you have to practice more and then, when you will become a new
Mozart, you will share it.

One day I saw a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0khsPZuXznY) from Rob
Chapman which, actually, encouraged me a lot. I decided to start publishing.
I finally got this feeling of confidence and critics-robustness. I hope to keep
on practicing and improve the quality of my playing/recording/creating videos
skills.

I bought a pickup for my western acoustic guitar, took GarageBand and iMovie,
put on a new strings and spent whole weekend trying to create something. It was
not easy at all :) So many things I had(and still have) to learn. First day I
recorded couple of classic pieces which I thought I could play decently:
["Zeit für Träume" by Klaus Schindler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLe-HB1WLO4)
and ["Prelude in E Minor" by Matteo Carcassi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtJ69YrA3Ok).
Second day I decided to spend just a couple of hours and record a small
self-composed tune called "Jenny". Finally, I spent about 10 hours recording
and creating the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_Ve3uiVsaA).

Doing that, I got some experience, now I know what I should improve and where I should put
more effort on. In a month or so I plan to record couple of more pieces. I hope
they will show some progress in my learning.

I would really appreciate your opinion about that, dear reader. Please, check
out my channel and let me know what do you think. Both "likes" and "dislikes" are
very welcome. If you like my content, there is a "Subscribe" button exist on
Youtube :)

Have a good time! See you soon!

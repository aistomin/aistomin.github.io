_I'm a software developer. Last years I'm focused on server side issues, 
including multi-threading, concurrency and complex business logic problems.
Mostly I use Java technologies(including Grails, Spring, Hibernate and other
frameworks)._ 

<br/>

_I have a lot of hobbies and interests such as music, literature, science etc.
Football is also a big part of my life. I'm a FC Bayern MÃ¼nchen fan._

_All the links to my public profiles you may find in the bottom of
the page. Those profiles describe me better than I could do it myself._
